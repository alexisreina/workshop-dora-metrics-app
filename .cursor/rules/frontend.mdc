# Summary

- Use Vue 3 and Nuxt 4 as the primary frameworks for all frontend development.
- Write all frontend code in TypeScript.
- Use PrimeVue as the main component library.
- Organize components, composables, and stores according to Nuxt conventions (e.g., `components/`, `composables/`, `stores/`).
- Prefer the Composition API for all new Vue components and logic.
- Ensure all components and composables are strongly typed.
- Use tailwindcss for styling the vue components.
- Follow established linting and formatting rules (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) for consistency.
- Write unit and integration tests for all components and composables, using the recommended testing tools for Vue/Nuxt.
- Document public components and composables with JSDoc/TSDoc comments.

## Additional Workflow Rules

- After making any changes to frontend code, always run `npm run build` to ensure the application builds successfully and to catch any build-time errors early.
- When installing new libraries or dependencies, always run `npm install` to update your local `node_modules` and lockfile before proceeding with further development or builds.
