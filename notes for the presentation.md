# Notes for Presentation

- Every specify will create a new branch
- Always open a new context tab in cursor for each step to avoid context
- Configuring running a project in windows that was created in mac is not easy
  - Maybe we should default to powershell on mac and windows
- A too complicated project makes speckit to give up
- /Specify + Jira MCP :
-- prompt 

```
please follow these steps 
first use mcp tool called mcp-atlassian, to grab the definition of the task in Jira JPB-52096, keep that definition in memory
then, with that defintion, use it as the input for a /specify  command 
```

- folders called .cursor/commands .specify/templates .specify/scripts need to be removed
