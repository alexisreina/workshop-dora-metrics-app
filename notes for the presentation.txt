# Notes for Presentation

- Every specify will create a new branch
- Always open a new context tab in cursor for each step to avoid context
- Configuring running a project in windows that was created in mac is not easy
  - Maybe we should default to powershell on mac and windows
- A too complicated project makes speckit to give up
