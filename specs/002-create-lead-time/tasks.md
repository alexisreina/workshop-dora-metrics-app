   → data-model.md: 4 entities (LeadTimeMetric, TrendData, DoraClassification, InsightData)
   → contracts/: 2 files (component-props.ts, lead-time-api.ts)
   → research.md: Chart.js selection, DORA thresholds, mock data strategy
3. Generate tasks by category ✅
   → Setup: dependencies, project structure
   → Tests: component tests, integration tests
   → Core: types, composables, components
   → Integration: page routing, mock data
   → Polish: accessibility, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules ✅
   → Different files = [P] for parallel
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T030) ✅
6. Generate dependency graph ✅
7. Create parallel execution examples ✅
8. Validate task completeness ✅
```

## Dependencies
**Critical Path**:
- Setup (T001-T003) → Types (T004-T007) → Tests (T008-T019) → Implementation (T020-T044)

**Parallel Blocks**:
- T004-T007: All type definitions (independent files)
- T008-T019: All test files (independent files)
- T020-T022: All utility functions (independent files)
- T023-T025: All composables (independent files)
- T026-T028: All atomic components (independent files)
- T029-T031: All molecular components (independent files)
- T036-T044: All polish tasks (independent files)

**Sequential Dependencies**:
- T032 requires T026-T031 (uses atomic and molecular components)
- T033 requires T032 (uses organism component)
- T034 requires T033 (uses template component)
- T035 requires T034 (page must exist before navigation)

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**:
   - component-props.ts → 8 component test tasks (T008-T014, T018)
   - lead-time-api.ts → 3 composable test tasks (T015-T017)
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - 4 entities → 4 type definition tasks (T004-T007) [P]
   - Business logic → 3 composable tasks (T023-T025) [P]
   
3. **From User Stories (Quickstart)**:
   - 6 test scenarios → integration and E2E tests (T018-T019)
   - Validation workflow → final validation task (T045)

4. **From Component Architecture**:
   - Atomic design → structured component tasks (T026-T033)
   - Page integration → routing tasks (T034-T035)

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T008-T019)
- [x] All entities have type definition tasks (T004-T007)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.3 before 3.4+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared state)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Dependencies clearly documented
- [x] Critical path identified (Setup → Types → Tests → Implementation)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies - can run simultaneously
- Verify all tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each completed task for incremental progress
- Use `npm run test` to verify test failures before implementation
- Use `npm run dev` to test components in browser during development
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax throughout
- Maintain Tailwind CSS utility-first approach for all styling
- Ensure PrimeVue components are used for UI consistency
- All components must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
