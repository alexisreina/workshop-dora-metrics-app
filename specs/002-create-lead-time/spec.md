# Feature Specification: Lead Time for Changes DORA Metric Screen

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-lead-time`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create \"Lead Time for Changes\" DORA Metric Screen (Tailwind CSS Styled Page) - Design and build a dedicated frontend page for displaying the DORA metric \"Lead Time for Changes.\" This screen will be integrated into the larger DORA metrics dashboard application but should be constructed as a self-contained page, focusing specifically on presenting this single metric."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Lead Time for Changes DORA metric display page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Development teams, Engineering managers, DevOps practitioners
   ‚Üí Actions: View metric, analyze trends, understand performance classification
   ‚Üí Data: Lead time measurements, historical trends, DORA benchmarks
   ‚Üí Constraints: Self-contained page, Tailwind CSS styling, responsive design
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clearly specified in Jira task
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: Navigate to page ‚Üí View current metric ‚Üí Analyze trend ‚Üí Understand classification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement derived from acceptance criteria in Jira task
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Lead Time Metric, Trend Data, DORA Classification
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What is the expected data refresh frequency for the Lead Time metric display? ‚Üí A: Manual refresh (user-triggered updates only)
- Q: What is the maximum historical time range that should be displayed in the trend visualization? ‚Üí A: Last 90 days (3 months)
- Q: What should happen when there is insufficient historical data to calculate a meaningful DORA classification? ‚Üí A: Show "Insufficient Data" badge with neutral color
- Q: What unit of measurement should be used for displaying lead time values? ‚Üí A: weeks
- Q: What performance target should be considered acceptable for page load time? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member or engineering manager, I want to view the Lead Time for Changes metric on a dedicated page so that I can understand how quickly our team delivers code changes from commit to production and track our performance over time against industry benchmarks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I navigate to the Lead Time for Changes page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a clear title "Lead Time for Changes" with a descriptive subtitle explaining what the metric measures
2. **Given** I am viewing the metric page, **When** I look at the primary display, **Then** I see the current lead time value prominently displayed with the time window context (e.g., "Last 30 days")
3. **Given** I want to understand trends, **When** I view the trend visualization, **Then** I see a line chart showing how lead time has changed over time with proper axis labels
4. **Given** I want to understand our performance level, **When** I view the classification section, **Then** I see a badge indicating our DORA classification (Elite, High, Medium, Low) with appropriate color coding
5. **Given** I want additional context, **When** I scroll to the insights section, **Then** I see explanatory text or summary about our performance
6. **Given** I am using a mobile device, **When** I view the page, **Then** all sections stack vertically and remain readable and functional

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metric data is loading or unavailable?
- How does the page handle very large or very small lead time values?
- What occurs when there's insufficient historical data for trend visualization?
- System displays "Insufficient Data" badge when unable to calculate meaningful DORA classification

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a prominent page header with the title "Lead Time for Changes"
- **FR-002**: System MUST include a descriptive subtitle explaining what the metric measures (average time from code commit to production deployment)
- **FR-003**: System MUST present the current lead time value in a visually prominent manner with large, bold typography
- **FR-004**: System MUST clearly indicate the time window or context for the displayed metric (e.g., "Last 30 days")
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the metric value within a card or panel design with visual emphasis
- **FR-006**: System MUST include a line chart visualization showing lead time trends over the last 90 days
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide proper axis labels for the trend chart ("Date", "Lead Time (weeks)")
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a DORA classification badge or tag (Elite, High, Medium, Low, or "Insufficient Data" with neutral color when data is inadequate)
- **FR-009**: System MUST use color-coded indicators for performance classification that follow accessibility guidelines
- **FR-010**: System MUST include an observation/insight section with explanatory text about performance
- **FR-011**: System MUST adapt responsively to different screen sizes
- **FR-012**: System MUST stack sections vertically on mobile devices while maintaining readability
- **FR-013**: System MUST use appropriate loading states or placeholders when data is not available
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a manual refresh mechanism for users to update metric data on demand
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain visual hierarchy with proper spacing and contrast
- **FR-015**: System MUST separate each section with appropriate padding and margins

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST load the initial page within 30 seconds under normal network conditions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Lead Time Metric**: Represents the current lead time value in weeks with associated time window and measurement context
- **Trend Data**: Historical lead time measurements over time for visualization purposes
- **DORA Classification**: Performance benchmark category (Elite, High, Medium, Low) with associated color coding and criteria
- **Insight Data**: Contextual information and explanatory text about current performance and trends
