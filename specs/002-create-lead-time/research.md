# Research: Lead Time for Changes DORA Metric Screen

**Feature**: Lead Time for Changes DORA Metric Display  
**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### Chart Visualization Library Selection

**Decision**: Chart.js with vue-chartjs wrapper  
**Rationale**: 
- Native Vue 3 integration with vue-chartjs
- Excellent performance for time-series data
- Built-in responsive design capabilities
- Strong accessibility features
- Extensive customization options for DORA metric styling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- D3.js: More powerful but overkill for simple line charts, steeper learning curve
- ApexCharts: Good alternative but Chart.js has better Vue ecosystem integration
- PrimeVue Chart: Limited customization options for specific DORA requirements

### DORA Classification Thresholds

**Decision**: Industry-standard DORA benchmarks  
**Rationale**: 
- Elite: < 1 day (< 0.14 weeks)
- High: 1 day to 1 week (0.14 - 1 weeks)  
- Medium: 1 week to 1 month (1 - 4.3 weeks)
- Low: > 1 month (> 4.3 weeks)
- Based on 2023 State of DevOps Report standards

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom thresholds: Would require domain expertise and validation
- Configurable thresholds: Adds complexity without clear business value

### Mock Data Strategy

**Decision**: Static TypeScript mock data with realistic patterns  
**Rationale**:
- Enables development without backend dependency
- Provides consistent test data for UI validation
- Includes edge cases (insufficient data, extreme values)
- Easy to modify for different scenarios

**Alternatives Considered**:
- API simulation: Unnecessary complexity for initial implementation
- Random data generation: Less predictable for testing and demos

### Responsive Design Approach

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS responsive utilities with mobile-first design  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with project's Tailwind CSS usage
- Mobile-first approach ensures core functionality on all devices
- Utility classes provide precise control over breakpoints
- Easy to maintain and modify

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CSS Grid/Flexbox only: Would require custom CSS, against Tailwind-first principle
- PrimeVue responsive components: Limited flexibility for custom layouts

### Accessibility Implementation

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML and ARIA labels  
**Rationale**:
- Color-blind friendly palette for DORA classification badges
- Screen reader support for chart data
- Keyboard navigation for interactive elements
- High contrast ratios for all text and indicators

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic accessibility: Insufficient for enterprise application requirements
- WCAG AAA: Overly restrictive for data visualization requirements

### Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Vue 3 lazy loading with chart rendering optimization  
**Rationale**:
- Chart component lazy loads to improve initial page load
- Data fetching happens after component mount
- Skeleton loading states provide immediate feedback
- Meets 30-second load time requirement with margin

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Server-side rendering: Unnecessary for client-side data visualization
- Aggressive caching: Conflicts with manual refresh requirement

## Technical Dependencies Confirmed

### Required NPM Packages
- `chart.js`: ^4.4.0 (chart rendering)
- `vue-chartjs`: ^5.3.0 (Vue 3 integration)
- `date-fns`: ^2.30.0 (date manipulation utilities)

### PrimeVue Components
- Card: Metric display containers
- Badge: DORA classification indicators  
- Button: Manual refresh functionality
- Skeleton: Loading states
- Panel: Section organization

### Tailwind CSS Utilities
- Responsive grid system
- Color palette for DORA classifications
- Typography scales for metric emphasis
- Spacing utilities for visual hierarchy

## Integration Patterns

### Composable Architecture
- `useLeadTimeData`: Data fetching and state management
- `useDoraClassification`: Classification logic and thresholds
- `useChartData`: Chart configuration and data transformation

### Component Communication
- Props down, events up pattern
- Provide/inject for deep component trees
- Reactive data flow with Vue 3 reactivity

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for composables and utilities
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Integration tests for user workflows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- Chart rendering with large datasets: Implement data sampling for >1000 points
- Memory leaks in chart components: Proper cleanup in onUnmounted hooks

### Accessibility Risks  
- Color-only classification: Include text labels and icons
- Chart data accessibility: Provide data table alternative

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browser requirement clearly documented
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Next Steps

All technical unknowns resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design and contracts generation.
