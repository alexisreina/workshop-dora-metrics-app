# Implementation Plan: Support "Change Failure Rate" DORA Metric

**Branch**: `008-support-change-failure` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-support-change-failure/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Add Change Failure Rate DORA metric support to the existing DORA Metrics application. This includes creating a dedicated page accessible via navigation that displays the Change Failure Rate as a percentage, shows historical trends over configurable time periods, and provides comparison against industry benchmarks. The system will automatically detect deployment failures through monitoring alerts within 24 hours and display the metric with appropriate context and explanations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Vue 3 Composition API, Node.js runtime  
**Primary Dependencies**: Nuxt 4, PrimeVue component library, Tailwind CSS, Vitest for testing  
**Storage**: File-based data storage (JSON/API simulation), no database required for current scope  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit/integration tests, contract testing for API endpoints  
**Target Platform**: Web application (SSR/SPA hybrid via Nuxt 4)
**Project Type**: web - full-stack Nuxt application with frontend components and backend API routes  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page load times, responsive UI interactions <100ms  
**Constraints**: Must follow existing atomic design pattern, integrate with current navigation system  
**Scale/Scope**: Single metric page with historical data visualization, ~5-10 new components

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**SOLID Principles Compliance**: ✅ PASS - Single responsibility components, dependency injection via composables  
**Vue 3 Composition API First**: ✅ PASS - All new components will use `<script setup>` syntax  
**Nuxt 4 Full-Stack Framework**: ✅ PASS - Leveraging Nuxt's file-based routing and server API routes  
**PrimeVue Component Library**: ✅ PASS - Using PrimeVue components for consistent UI  
**Tailwind CSS Utility-First**: ✅ PASS - All styling via Tailwind utility classes  
**KISS Principle**: ✅ PASS - Simple metric display page, no over-engineering  
**Code Quality Standards**: ✅ PASS - TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier validation required

**Atomic Design Compliance**: ✅ PASS - Following existing atoms/molecules/organisms structure  
**Testing Strategy**: ✅ PASS - Unit tests for composables, integration tests for user flows

**Overall Assessment**: All constitutional principles can be followed without violations.

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**: ✅ PASS - Design artifacts maintain constitutional compliance:

- Data model follows SOLID principles with clear entity separation
- API contracts use standard REST patterns (KISS principle)
- Component structure follows atomic design (existing pattern)
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- No complex abstractions introduced unnecessarily

```

**Structure Decision**: Nuxt 4 full-stack web application structure selected. The existing atomic design pattern (atoms/molecules/organisms/templates) will be extended with new Change Failure Rate components. API routes will be added under `server/api/metrics/` following the existing pattern.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API contract endpoints → contract test tasks [P]
- Data model entities → TypeScript interface tasks [P]
- User story scenarios → integration test tasks
- Component structure → atomic design component tasks
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Specific Task Categories**:

1. **Contract Tests** (Parallel):
   - Test `/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/` endpoint
   - Test `/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/historical` endpoint
   - Test `/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/benchmarks` endpoint

2. **Type Definitions** (Parallel):
   - Create ChangeFailureRateMetric interface
   - Create DeploymentRecord interface
   - Create FailureEvent interface
   - Create TimePeriod and BenchmarkData interfaces

3. **API Implementation**:
   - Implement current metric endpoint
   - Implement historical data endpoint
   - Implement benchmarks endpoint
   - Add mock data generation

4. **Component Development** (Following atomic design):
   - Atoms: MetricValue, BenchmarkIndicator, TimeFilter
   - Molecules: MetricCard, TrendChart, FilterBar
   - Organisms: ChangeFailureRateSection
   - Page: change-failure-rate.vue

5. **Integration Tasks**:
   - Add navigation menu item
   - Create composable for CFR data fetching
   - Implement page routing
   - Add error handling and loading states

6. **Testing Tasks**:
   - Unit tests for composables
   - Component tests for UI elements
   - Integration tests for user workflows
   - Contract test validation

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Contract tests → API implementation → Component tests → UI components
- Dependency order: Types → API → Composables → Components → Page → Navigation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
