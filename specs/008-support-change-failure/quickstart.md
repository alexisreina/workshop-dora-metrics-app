# Quickstart: Change Failure Rate DORA Metric

**Date**: 2025-10-02  
**Feature**: Support "Change Failure Rate" DORA Metric  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This quickstart guide validates the Change Failure Rate feature implementation through user story scenarios. Each scenario represents a key user workflow that must be supported.

## Prerequisites

- Nuxt 4 application running locally
- Test data populated (deployments and failure events)
- Navigation system functional

## User Story Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: View Current Change Failure Rate

**Story**: As a DevOps team member, I want to view the current Change Failure Rate so I can understand deployment quality.

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to the main DORA Metrics dashboard
2. Click on "Change Failure Rate" in the navigation menu
3. Verify the page loads within 200ms
4. Confirm the current CFR percentage is displayed prominently
5. Check that the metric shows whole numbers only (e.g., "15%" not "15.3%")
6. Verify the total deployments and failed deployments are shown
7. Confirm the time period is displayed (default: "Last 30 days")

**Expected Results**:

- Page loads successfully at `/metrics/change-failure-rate`
- Current CFR percentage is visible and correctly formatted
- Supporting data (totals, period) is clearly displayed
- Page follows existing design patterns and styling

### Scenario 2: View Historical Trends

**Story**: As an engineering manager, I want to see CFR trends over time to identify patterns.

**Steps**:

1. From the Change Failure Rate page
2. Locate the historical trend chart/visualization
3. Verify data points are shown for multiple time periods
4. Check that the chart is interactive and accessible
5. Confirm trend direction is visually clear (improving/degrading)
6. Verify data quality indicators are present if applicable

**Expected Results**:

- Historical data is displayed in a clear chart format
- Multiple data points show trend over time
- Chart follows accessibility guidelines
- Data quality status is communicated to users

### Scenario 3: Filter by Time Period

**Story**: As a team lead, I want to filter CFR data by different time periods to analyze specific timeframes.

**Steps**:

1. From the Change Failure Rate page
2. Locate the time period filter controls
3. Select "Weekly" from the available options
4. Verify the metric updates to show weekly data
5. Try "Quarterly" filter option
6. Confirm the data and chart update accordingly
7. Check that the selected filter is visually indicated

**Expected Results**:

- Filter controls are intuitive and accessible
- Data updates correctly when filters are applied
- Selected filter state is clearly shown
- Available options match specification (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)

### Scenario 4: Compare Against Industry Benchmarks

**Story**: As a DevOps manager, I want to see how our CFR compares to industry standards.

**Steps**:

1. From the Change Failure Rate page
2. Locate the benchmark comparison section
3. Verify industry benchmark categories are displayed
4. Check that current CFR is positioned relative to benchmarks
5. Confirm benchmark descriptions are clear and helpful
6. Verify the data source is attributed (DORA research)

**Expected Results**:

- Benchmark categories (elite, high, medium, low) are shown
- Current metric is visually compared to benchmarks
- Benchmark ranges and descriptions are clear
- Data source attribution is present

### Scenario 5: Navigate from Main Dashboard

**Story**: As a user, I want to easily access the CFR page from the main dashboard.

**Steps**:

1. Start from the main dashboard (`/`)
2. Locate the Change Failure Rate navigation item
3. Click to navigate to the CFR page
4. Verify smooth navigation without page refresh
5. Use browser back button to return to dashboard
6. Confirm navigation state is maintained

**Expected Results**:

- CFR navigation item is visible and accessible
- Navigation works smoothly (SPA behavior)
- Browser navigation (back/forward) works correctly
- Active navigation state is indicated

### Scenario 6: Handle No Data State

**Story**: As a user, I want clear messaging when no deployment data is available.

**Steps**:

1. Configure test environment with no deployment data
2. Navigate to the Change Failure Rate page
3. Verify appropriate "no data" messaging is displayed
4. Check that the message is helpful and actionable
5. Confirm the page layout remains intact
6. Verify no errors are thrown in browser console

**Expected Results**:

- Clear "insufficient data" message is shown
- Message explains why data is unavailable
- Page layout and navigation remain functional
- No JavaScript errors occur

### Scenario 7: Handle Error States

**Story**: As a user, I want clear error messaging when data cannot be loaded.

**Steps**:

1. Configure test environment to simulate API errors
2. Navigate to the Change Failure Rate page
3. Verify error state is handled gracefully
4. Check that error message is user-friendly
5. Confirm retry mechanisms are available if applicable
6. Verify the page remains navigable

**Expected Results**:

- Error states are handled without breaking the page
- Error messages are clear and non-technical
- User can still navigate away from the page
- Appropriate retry options are provided

## API Endpoint Validation

### Test Current Metric Endpoint

```bash
# Test default monthly period
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/"

# Test with specific period
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/?period=weekly"

# Test with custom date range
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/?startDate=2025-09-01&endDate=2025-10-01"
```

**Expected Response**:

- Status: 200 OK
- Content-Type: application/json
- Response matches OpenAPI schema
- Values are within expected ranges

### Test Historical Data Endpoint

```bash
# Test historical trends
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/historical?period=monthly&limit=12"
```

**Expected Response**:

- Array of historical data points
- Consistent data structure
- Proper date formatting

### Test Benchmarks Endpoint

```bash
# Test benchmark data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/change-failure-rate/benchmarks"
```

**Expected Response**:
