# Tasks: Support "Change Failure Rate" DORA Metric

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-support-change-failure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Nuxt 4, Vue 3 Composition API, PrimeVue, TypeScript
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 5 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/change-failure-rate-api.yaml: 3 endpoints → contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 7 scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: TypeScript types, dependencies
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: API endpoints, composables, components
   → Integration: navigation, routing, error handling
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Nuxt 4 web app**: `app/` for frontend, `app/server/api/` for backend
- **Tests**: `tests/contract/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/unit/`
- Paths follow existing Nuxt 4 atomic design structure

```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task completion
- Follow existing atomic design patterns
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Integrate with existing PrimeVue components
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Task Generation Rules

_Applied during main() execution_

1. **From Contracts**:
   - change-failure-rate-api.yaml → 3 contract test tasks [P]
   - Each endpoint → corresponding implementation task
2. **From Data Model**:
   - 5 entities → 5 TypeScript interface tasks [P]
   - Enums → 1 enum definition task [P]
3. **From User Stories**:
   - 7 quickstart scenarios → 7 integration test tasks [P]
   - Each scenario → validation task in polish phase

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → API → Composables → Components → Page → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution within phases

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before task execution_

- [x] All 3 contracts have corresponding tests (T006-T008)
- [x] All 5 entities have TypeScript interface tasks (T001-T005)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T006-T015 before T016+)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] TDD approach maintained (tests fail first)
- [x] Atomic design pattern followed
- [x] Integration with existing navigation system planned
