# Feature Specification: Support "Change Failure Rate" DORA Metric

**Feature Branch**: `008-support-change-failure`  
**Created**: 2025-10-02  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "support "Change Failure Rate" DORA metric"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: What specific filtering dimensions should be available for Change Failure Rate data? ‚Üí A: Time periods only (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Q: What should Change Failure Rate performance be compared against? ‚Üí A: Industry benchmarks only (DORA research standards)
- Q: How many decimal places should be shown for Change Failure Rate precision? ‚Üí A: 0 decimal places (whole percentages: 15%)
- Q: How should the system determine what constitutes a "deployment failure" for calculating Change Failure Rate? ‚Üí A: Automatic detection via monitoring alerts within 24 hours
- Q: What should be the default time period displayed when users first visit the Change Failure Rate page? ‚Üí A: Last 30 days (monthly view)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a DevOps team member or engineering manager, I want to view and track the Change Failure Rate metric in the DORA Metrics application, so that I can understand what percentage of deployments are causing failures in production and identify opportunities to improve deployment quality and reliability.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user navigates to the Change Failure Rate metrics page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see the current change failure rate percentage and understand what it represents
2. **Given** a user is viewing the Change Failure Rate dashboard, **When** they look at the metric display, **Then** they can see historical trends and patterns in failure rates over time
3. **Given** a user wants to understand their deployment quality, **When** they access the Change Failure Rate metric, **Then** they can see how their current rate compares to industry benchmarks or targets
4. **Given** a user is analyzing deployment failures, **When** they view the Change Failure Rate details, **Then** they can see breakdowns by time period, team, or deployment type
5. **Given** a user navigates from the main dashboard, **When** they click on the Change Failure Rate navigation item, **Then** they are taken to the dedicated Change Failure Rate metrics page

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there is no deployment data available? System MUST display appropriate messaging indicating insufficient data
- How does the system handle periods with zero deployments? System MUST show clear indicators when no deployments occurred
- What happens when all deployments in a period failed? System MUST display 100% failure rate with appropriate context
- How should the system display very low failure rates (e.g., 0.1%)? System MUST show precise percentages with appropriate decimal places
- What happens when deployment data is incomplete or corrupted? System MUST show error states and data quality indicators

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display the Change Failure Rate as a percentage representing deployments that caused production failures
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a dedicated page accessible via navigation for viewing Change Failure Rate metrics
- **FR-003**: System MUST show historical trends of Change Failure Rate over configurable time periods
- **FR-004**: System MUST display the current Change Failure Rate value prominently on the metrics page
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear definition and explanation of what Change Failure Rate measures
- **FR-006**: System MUST show Change Failure Rate data in visual formats such as charts or graphs
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to filter Change Failure Rate data by time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- **FR-008**: System MUST indicate data freshness and last update time for Change Failure Rate metrics
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cases where no deployment data is available with appropriate messaging
- **FR-010**: System MUST display Change Failure Rate alongside context such as total deployments and failure counts
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide tooltips or help text explaining how Change Failure Rate is calculated
- **FR-012**: System MUST show Change Failure Rate performance against industry benchmarks based on DORA research standards
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow navigation back to the main dashboard from the Change Failure Rate page
- **FR-014**: System MUST display error states when Change Failure Rate data cannot be loaded or calculated
- **FR-015**: System MUST show Change Failure Rate as whole percentages with no decimal places (e.g., 15%)
- **FR-016**: System MUST automatically detect deployment failures through monitoring alerts triggered within 24 hours of deployment
- **FR-017**: System MUST display Change Failure Rate data for the last 30 days by default when users first visit the page

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Change Failure Rate Metric**: Represents the calculated percentage of deployments that resulted in production failures, includes current value, historical data, and calculation metadata
- **Deployment Record**: Represents individual deployment events with success/failure status, timestamp, and associated metadata for calculating failure rates
- **Failure Event**: Represents production incidents or failures linked to specific deployments, used to determine which deployments caused failures
- **Time Period Filter**: Represents configurable date ranges for viewing Change Failure Rate trends and historical data
- **Metric Display Configuration**: Represents user preferences for how Change Failure Rate data is visualized and presented
