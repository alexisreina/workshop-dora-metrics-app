# Implementation Plan: Deployment Frequency View

**Branch**: `002-deployment-frequency-view` | **Date**: 2025-10-02 | **Spec**: C:\Repo\workshop-dora-metrics-app\specs\002-deployment-frequency-view\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-deployment-frequency-view/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Provide a Deployment Frequency view showing counts of successful Production deployments over time with presets (14/30/90 days, 6 months, custom), grouping (day/week/month), filters (project/repository/environment), local timezone, and an optional 7-day rolling average (day only). DF counts only case-insensitive exact-match environments `prod` or `production`. Deterministic in-memory fake data seeded for 6 months with realistic seasonality and failure distribution.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Nuxt 4, Vue 3)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Nuxt 4, Vue 3 Composition API, PrimeVue, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: In-memory only (deterministic fake data)  
**Testing**: Vitest + Vue Test Utils (unit), contract tests stubs  
**Target Platform**: Web (Nuxt app)
**Project Type**: web (Nuxt full-stack)  
**Performance Goals**: Render DF view < 200ms with 6 months data on modern laptop  
**Constraints**: No external calls; deterministic outputs for same inputs  
**Scale/Scope**: Single page/view with mock API facade

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Frontend Application Compliance
- [ ] **SOLID Principles**: All components follow single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion
- [ ] **Vue 3 Composition API**: Components use `<script setup>` syntax and Composition API patterns
- [ ] **Nuxt 4 Framework**: Leveraging Nuxt 4 for full-stack capabilities, SSR, and module system
- [ ] **PrimeVue Components**: Using PrimeVue component library for UI elements
- [ ] **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach with minimal custom CSS
- [ ] **KISS Principle**: Complexity justified, simple solutions preferred
- [ ] **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier compliance, TypeScript usage
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for composables, component tests, integration tests for user flows

```

**Structure Decision**: Nuxt 4 full-stack application; implement UI in `app/pages/df.vue` and `app/components/df/*`, composables in `app/composables/df/*`, in-memory API facade under `app/server/api/df/*`, utilities under `app/utils/df/*`, tests under `tests/unit` and `tests/integration`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Series endpoint: GET `/api/df/series` → returns aggregated series by range, grouping, filters, rollingAvg toggle
   - Summary endpoint: GET `/api/df/summary` → returns totals and previous-period deltas
   - Events endpoint: GET `/api/df/events` → returns raw events (includes non-Production)
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/openapi.yaml`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Default 6 months, day grouping → chart + summary + table shown, deterministic counts
   - Week ISO-8601 grouping label format `yyyy-Www` verified
   - Rolling average visible only for day, partial-window for <7 days
   - Filters apply; DF counts only exact-match Production environments
   - Summary includes delta and percent change vs previous period

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
