## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Frontend Focus**: Specifications should emphasize user experience, component interactions, and UI/UX requirements

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - UI/UX requirements and accessibility
   - Component behavior and interactions
   - Responsive design requirements

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02

- Q: How should weeks be defined and labeled? ‚Üí A: ISO-8601, weeks start Monday; label `yyyy-Www`.
- Q: For ranges under 7 days, what should the 7-day rolling average do? ‚Üí A: Compute partial-window average over available days.
- Q: Should the summary include comparison to previous period? ‚Üí A: Yes‚Äîdelta and percent change.
- Q: How should filters source selectable values? ‚Üí A: Static predefined lists (deterministic).
- Q: For Production matching, treat partial names like `prod-eu`? ‚Üí A: No‚Äîexact `prod` or `production` only (case-insensitive).

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an engineering leader or team member, I want to see how often we successfully deploy to Production over time so that I can understand release cadence, spot trends, and identify anomalies without relying on external systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the Deployment Frequency view loads with defaults, **When** no preset is selected by the user, **Then** the view shows Production deployment counts over the last 6 months with a chart, a summary, and a table of raw events.
2. **Given** range presets exist, **When** the user selects 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, or Custom, **Then** the chart, summary, and table refresh deterministically for that range.
3. **Given** grouping controls exist, **When** the user toggles between Day, Week, or Month, **Then** the series re-buckets accordingly and labels follow: day `yyyy-mm-dd`, week `yyyy-Www` (ISO-8601, weeks start Monday), month `yyyy-mm`.
4. **Given** a 7-day rolling average toggle, **When** grouping is Day and the toggle is ON, **Then** a 7-day rolling average line is shown; **And** when grouping is Week or Month, the toggle is disabled or hidden.
5. **Given** filters for Project, Repository, and Environment, **When** filters are applied, **Then** the DF metric counts only successful deployments to Production (case-insensitive exact match: `production` or `prod` only) while the raw events table may still include non-Production entries for context.
6. **Given** local timezone usage, **When** data is bucketed and displayed, **Then** all timestamps and bucket boundaries reflect the user's local timezone, with deployment times constrained to 08:00‚Äì20:00.
7. **Given** deterministic fake data with a seed and default 6 months of history, **When** the user refreshes or revisits, **Then** the same inputs produce identical series, summary, and events.
8. **Given** seasonality, **When** viewing distributions, **Then** Tuesdays‚ÄìThursdays have higher counts, weekends are lower, occasional burst days appear, and overall failure rates are ~10‚Äì15% with higher success rates in Production relative to non-Production.
9. **Given** DF counts Production only, **When** environments include non-Production entries, **Then** those events do not contribute to the DF counts but are visible in the raw events table.

### Edge Cases

- No deployments in selected range ‚Üí chart shows zero counts, summary shows zeros, table may be empty.
- Custom date range extends beyond available 6-month default dataset ‚Üí out-of-range dates show zero counts.
- All filtered results are non-Production or failed ‚Üí DF series shows zeros; raw table still lists matching events.
- Short ranges (< 7 days) with rolling average ON ‚Üí compute partial-window average over available days.
- Week grouping across year boundary ‚Üí label format `yyyy-Www` follows ISO-8601 (weeks start Monday) and may roll over.
- Daylight saving transitions ‚Üí bucket by local time; ensure boundaries track timezone shifts.
- Environments like `prod-eu` or `production-us` should NOT count toward DF; only exact `prod` or `production` match (case-insensitive) contributes.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display Production deployment counts over time as a chart with presets: 14 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and Custom.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support grouping by Day, Week, and Month with labels: Day `yyyy-mm-dd`, Week `yyyy-Www` (ISO-8601, weeks start Monday), Month `yyyy-mm`.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide filters for Project, Repository, and Environment.
- **FR-004**: System MUST compute DF using only successful deployments to Production environments, with case-insensitive exact match on environment name: `production` or `prod` only.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use the local timezone for bucketing and displaying timestamps.
- **FR-006**: System MUST offer a 7-day rolling average toggle that is available only when grouping is Day; for ranges shorter than 7 days, compute a partial-window average over available days.
- **FR-007**: System MUST present a summary alongside the chart for the selected range and grouping, including at minimum total Production deployments, average per selected bucket, and comparison to the previous equivalent period (delta and percent change).
- **FR-008**: System MUST show a table of raw deployment events that includes non-Production entries for context and includes status to distinguish successes/failures.
- **FR-014**: Filter selectable values (Project, Repository, Environment) MUST come from static predefined lists to preserve determinism.
- **FR-009**: System MUST default to a deterministic fake dataset covering the last six months, seeded so that repeated sessions with the same seed produce identical outputs.
- **FR-010**: System MUST model realistic distributions: higher Tue‚ÄìThu counts, lower weekends, occasional burst days, and ~10‚Äì15% failures with higher Production success rates vs non-Production; events occur between 08:00 and 20:00 local time.
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow selecting a Custom date range via start and end dates with no hard maximum; selection is constrained to the available dataset range.
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure DF always counts Production-only events; non-Production events must not contribute to DF counts.
- **FR-013**: System MUST behave deterministically for the same inputs (range, grouping, filters, seed).

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Deployment Event**: Represents a single deployment attempt; attributes: id, timestamp (local), project, repository, environment, status (success/failure), duration [optional], notes/tags [optional].
- **Deployment Series**: Aggregation of counts per bucket; attributes: grouping (Day/Week/Month), buckets [{ label, start, end, count }], optional rollingAverage when Day and toggle ON.
- **Deployment Summary**: Totals for selected range/grouping; attributes: totalProductionSuccesses, averagePerBucket, previousPeriodDelta, previousPeriodPercentChange.
- **Filters**: Current filter selections; attributes: project, repository, environment. Values sourced from static predefined lists (deterministic).
