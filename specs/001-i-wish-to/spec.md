# Feature Specification: Jira Active Ticket Listing

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-wish-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I wish to create a backend request to JIRA to obtain my currently active Jira tickets and a frontend page that will list them. I want it to be listed as raw text with the Jira Ticket code and the Summary of the ticket. Also, I am unaware of what is needed to connect to Jira, investigate that and inform me how to do it"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How should the app authenticate against Jira Cloud when fetching tickets? ‚Üí A: OAuth 2.0 integration using Atlassian Connect
- Q: How should ‚Äúactive‚Äù Jira tickets be filtered? ‚Üí A: `assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done`
- Q: How often should we refresh Jira data before showing it to the user? ‚Üí A: Every 5 minutes, cached between refreshes

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer monitoring my work, I want the Dora Metrics app to show my currently active Jira tickets so I can review them quickly without leaving the dashboard.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Jira connection is configured and the user has active tickets, **When** the user opens the Active Jira Tickets view, **Then** the page displays each ticket as `ISSUE-KEY - Summary` in raw text.
2. **Given** the Jira API returns no active tickets for the user, **When** the view loads, **Then** the page presents an empty-state message explaining that there are no active tickets.
3. **Given** the Jira API call fails due to authentication or network issues, **When** the view loads, **Then** the user sees an error notification and no outdated ticket data.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Jira returns more tickets than the page can display at once (pagination or load-more)?
- How does the system behave when Jira rate limits or returns partial failures?
- What should be displayed if a ticket lacks a summary or has formatting that breaks raw text output?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST retrieve the authenticated user‚Äôs active Jira tickets using the Jira REST API.
- **FR-002**: System MUST authenticate to Jira via OAuth 2.0 (Atlassian Connect) with client credentials stored outside source control.
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose a backend endpoint that returns each ticket‚Äôs issue key and summary in responses.
- **FR-004**: Frontend MUST render the list of tickets as raw text lines in the format `ISSUE-KEY - Summary`.
- **FR-005**: Frontend MUST meet accessibility requirements (keyboard navigable, WCAG 2.2 AA contrast) and remain usable if JavaScript enhancements fail.
- **FR-006**: System MUST log API calls, including success/failure status, latency, and rate-limit headers, to the shared telemetry pipeline.
- **FR-007**: System MUST refresh data on a configurable interval to keep displayed tickets current without violating Jira rate limits.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide user-facing feedback when Jira is unreachable or credentials are invalid.
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that only tickets assigned to the current authenticated user are shown.
- **FR-010**: System MUST query Jira using the JQL `assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done` to define active tickets.
- **FR-011**: System MUST cache Jira results for up to 5 minutes and refresh automatically when the cache expires.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **JiraIssueSummary**: Represents a single ticket with fields `{ key, summary }` returned to the frontend.
- **JiraConnectionConfig**: Holds Jira site URL, OAuth 2.0 client credentials (client ID, secret, scopes), and refresh interval settings managed via secured configuration.
