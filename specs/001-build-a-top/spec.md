# Feature Specification: Build a top bar with the app name and a sidebar where we can place internal navigation to the different metrics, for the index page build just a welcome page with some description of what the app is about

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-top`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a top bar with the app name and a sidebar where we can place internal navigation to the different metrics, for the index page build just a welcome page with some description of what the app is about"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")
- **Frontend Focus**: Specifications should emphasize user experience, component interactions, and UI/UX requirements

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - UI/UX requirements and accessibility
   - Component behavior and interactions
   - Responsive design requirements

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: What should the application name be displayed in the top bar? ‚Üí A: "DORA Metrics App"
- Q: How should the sidebar behave on mobile devices? ‚Üí A: Collapsible/hamburger menu that hides sidebar by default
- Q: What specific metrics sections should be available in the sidebar navigation? ‚Üí A: Just placeholder sections for now
- Q: How should the sidebar handle many navigation items? ‚Üí A: Vertical scrolling within sidebar
- Q: What should the welcome page description include about the DORA metrics app? ‚Üí A: Simple "Welcome to DORA Metrics" with basic description
- Q: How should the current navigation section be highlighted in the sidebar? ‚Üí A: Background color change
- Q: What should the placeholder navigation sections display? ‚Üí A: Generic labels like "Metrics 1", "Metrics 2"
- Q: What should happen when a navigation item is clicked but the target page doesn't exist yet? ‚Üí A: Navigate to welcome page with notification
- Q: What should happen when the hamburger menu is clicked on mobile but the sidebar is already open? ‚Üí A: Close the sidebar
- Q: What specific content should the welcome page include about DORA metrics? ‚Üí A: Brief explanation of what DORA metrics measure

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user visiting the DORA metrics application, I want to see a clear navigation structure with a top bar showing the app name and a sidebar for accessing different metrics sections, so that I can easily understand what the app does and navigate to specific metrics.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user visits the application homepage, **When** they load the page, **Then** they see a top bar with the app name and a sidebar with navigation options
2. **Given** a user is on the homepage, **When** they view the welcome content, **Then** they see a description explaining what the DORA metrics app is about
3. **Given** a user sees the sidebar navigation, **When** they click on a metrics section, **Then** they are navigated to that specific metrics page
4. **Given** a user is on any page, **When** they look at the top bar, **Then** they can always see the app name and understand which application they're using

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the sidebar has many navigation items? System MUST support vertical scrolling within sidebar
- How does the layout behave on mobile devices? System MUST implement collapsible sidebar with hamburger menu
- What happens when a navigation item is clicked but the target page doesn't exist yet? System MUST navigate to welcome page with notification
- What happens when the hamburger menu is clicked on mobile but sidebar is already open? System MUST close the sidebar
- How does the app handle navigation when sidebar is collapsed on mobile? System MUST allow navigation via hamburger menu toggle
- How should the current navigation section be visually indicated? System MUST use background color change for highlighting

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a top bar containing the application name "DORA Metrics App"
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a sidebar with navigation links to placeholder metrics sections labeled "Metrics 1", "Metrics 2", etc.
- **FR-003**: System MUST show a welcome page on the index route with brief explanation of what DORA metrics measure
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to navigate between different metrics sections via sidebar
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain consistent top bar and sidebar across all pages
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the app name "DORA Metrics App" prominently in the top bar
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear navigation structure for accessing metrics
- **FR-008**: System MUST show simple welcome content with basic DORA metrics description on the welcome page
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle navigation clicks and route users to appropriate sections

- **FR-014**: System MUST navigate to welcome page with notification when clicking non-existent navigation items
- **FR-015**: System MUST close sidebar when hamburger menu is clicked on mobile if sidebar is already open

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Navigation Item**: Represents a clickable link in the sidebar, contains display text and target route
- **App Branding**: Represents the application name and visual identity displayed in the top bar
- **Welcome Content**: Represents the descriptive text and information shown on the homepage about the app's purpose
